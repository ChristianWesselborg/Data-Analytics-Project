# Data-Analytics-Project
CDC 500 cities data set. Investigating population and frequencies of health issues.

This is the code repository for assignment 6 in the BCBP 4960 Data Analytics course at RPI Fall 2019.
This is not intended to be a thorough and rigerous analysis of the data set.
The project is more a learning experience working with data and RStudio.

I, Christian Wesselborg, am the sole contributor and manager of this repository.
